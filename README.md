# Book_Database

A book database class will contain a method to return a book object. 
We haven't exactly learned how to create a database or read/write to files yet. 
We're going to use the knowledge we already have to create a class. 
Our class will simulate a database and return a populated book object.
We'll simulate a database by simply using if or switch statements to look up a book based on SKU. 
Create a database using Oracle that also returns a book object.

Our book database will contain several book titles and the SKU code to look one up.


Create a class that contains a method that takes one parameter, the SKU, and returns a corresponding book object. 
Use If Statements to populate the instance variables of the Book class and return the populated Book class.
